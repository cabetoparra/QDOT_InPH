# QDOT_InPH: 
Protram to characterize the spectral properties of an epitaxially-grown semiconductor heterostructure

1) Compute wavefunctions and eigenvalues for a predetermined/designed heterostructure, both valence and conduction band
2) Compute transition oscillator strengths
3) Radial density profile for desired wavefunctions
4) Auger scattering rates
